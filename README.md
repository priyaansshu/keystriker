KeyStriker is a typing game I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a fun way to increase your typing speed and learn/practice Touch Typing.

Once you press play, the 30-second timer starts and one key at random would be highlighted on the virtual keyboard on the screen, all you have to do is press that key on your keyboard and do this for as many keys as you can before time runs out. This is the Classic mode where you try to score as much as you can. There are also 3 challenge modes:

🐢 Easy: You need to strike 20 keys in 30 seconds 
🚗 Medium: 30 keys in 30 seconds
🚀 Hard: 40 keys in 30 seconds 

You can also tweet the score directly if you win.
